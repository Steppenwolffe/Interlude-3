## Success

It took conversations with my friend Lee and learning the culture and way of Tumblr to understand that this was a good medium. It takes time to archive things and curate the experience but for all the times of media and for the experience of it to make sense Tumblr is great.

Beyond getting followers it gives me a way to get feedback as I create. I feel this is meaningful when we are talking about playful engagement with history. It makes it dynamic, easy to learn and adapt and almost like a live organism. It also is seamless to share everything with one centralized link. I’m growing and inviting friends to dialogue with it as well.


## Failure

I wasn’t as through with engaging with computation as I’d like to be for the project. For the final an Unessay. Thing that are difficult:

-       Researching and experimenting with Tumblr in relation to procedural generation.

-       Tumblr is not something I fully understand yet. There seems to be an export function, but I don’t know how that will translate to exporting the entirety of the data or individual parts. Will I need to use web scraping?

-       After I figure out the middleman between Tumblr and the final product, I should pick some specific.

-       Simplifying and realistically assessing a way to produce the final essay would help me measure and work towards what it will finally come to

## Moving Forward

I will continue to post and archive things on the two accounts.

Start to explore ways to translate the Tumblr blog into a game.

Think If I can problem solve the pieces, I failed with things will move forward.

Experimenting with reblogging to gain information about the culture and meaningful interractions:

Tumblr has been where I have put all the archives I’ve created. Although this isn’t a recording or screen shot of mistakes it has been where I’ve been experimenting, learning, and dialoguing.  How I have developed and moved forward form the last point of conversation.
