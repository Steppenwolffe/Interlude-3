For my Unessay I devise to use a Tumblr account to document and archive different kinds of media around two separate conflicting artistic forces I feel are inside of me.

I have spent some time starting these blogs and filling these Tumblr spaces with poems, drawings, pictures, sound clips that represent the individual voices.

To then be able to dialogue or speak to let’s say either the light artist or the dark artist. To also be able to have the light and dark artist talk to each other.

Beyond creating the pieces deciding which place I put them and how I place them in the realm of the Tumblr space has an effect for engagement.

Levels of the experience.

The first level is that of the story. This is what we learned in module one. The significance of what we share and don't share. How we chose to tell the story. For example, some of what I posted on the Tumblr alludes to mental health, a destructive nature even religion. The way I chose to capture this story is just as significant as the subject matter. There are photos and poems that go well with each other or capture well the sentiment I am trying to express about each artistic nature. And others that are watery or not as sharp and clear in what they are capturing.

Secondly, the arrangement of photos, mixed with other media and how you emotionally move as you go through the archive is its' own phenomena. This level has to do with the difference between good playful and remixes of engagement. Throughout the process of archiving and listening to reactions I got online I discovered what was capturing an engaging essence of either a light or dark nature and what was good but not the strongest expression. Timing, hash tagging(coding the expression) and honesty all play a role in whether people engage with what you are creating. I got to see this in real time through experimenting with Tumblr.

Challenges in problem solving framework, in raising the dead

The challenges in raising the dead of the archives I've created are related to whether the meaning and play of the story gets picked up by computation and procedural generation. That is the problem space in this instance. the archives are creative interpretations of events and emotions in life. Some of the poems are about literal things but they are a metaphor for being human and different philosophies in life. Sometimes an individual makes sense with the other images but not alone.

Relative to the problem space network the game elements informed by the archive need careful alignment to translate to authentic engagement with the player agent. The goal like the history is elusive and non-literal. This requires understanding and experimenting with how the procedural generation informed by archives becomes expressed and how the player agent receives the expression.  Perhaps the symbol in a prompt is interpreted without engagement. If this is true things need to be toggles. I noticed in playing some of the examples of games in class and looking at a description of them that there is this real sense of, "wanting to play" and moving in flow with the experience. There is this sense of the generation dialoguing with how you are dialoguing with it taking you through the journey with the spirit you are giving to it. In Dr. Graham words, "To be ‘good’ at a game is to perform (uncritically) the vision of the world that its creators have encoded in the rules" (125).  The idea of accurately capturing the spirit of history into a good experience of a game has to do with matching the player understanding with what the game is communicating.

Different mediums are chosen to capture history. Each medium will express significance differently. This adds a level of complexity in terms of sound of a voice and volume. Light and dark areas in a photo.  How drawing and colours are interpreted. Versus imagery and rhythm in a poem.

Space and Time is significant in the archives I made to put into the individual history records on Tumblr. Synonymously, it is significant in how it is relayed back to the game player and other agents it will be designed around.

Success

It took conversations with my friend Lee and learning the culture and way of Tumblr to understand that this was a good medium. It takes time to archive things and curate the experience but for all the times of media and for the experience of it to make sense Tumblr is great.

Beyond getting followers it gives me a way to get feedback as I create. I feel this is meaningful when we are talking about playful engagement with history. It makes it dynamic, easy to learn and adapt and almost like a live organism. It also is seamless to share everything with one centralized link. I’m growing and inviting friends to dialogue with it as well.
